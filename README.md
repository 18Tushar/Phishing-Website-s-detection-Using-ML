Implemented a Phishing URL Detection system using Machine Learning (ML), integrating two algorithms: Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The project utilized FastAPI for real-time URL analysis and response. Comprehensive preprocessing involved tokenization, count vectorization, and visualization of hidden links using networkx. Three datasets were merged into a 30MB frame, addressing target column imbalances, and achieving a usability score of 10.0. The logistic regression model demonstrated high accuracy (90.96%), and the entire pipeline was saved using Pickle for future use.
